### Artist Guide

All assets will be placed in `/config/openloader/resources/pack/assets` and will be loaded from there.
File format is **lower_snake_case** with the file type being **.png**

Artists should use Github Desktop to commit their changes to their forked repository.
Forking the repository will allow you to make changes to the repository without affecting the main repository.
Once you have made your additions, open a pull request to the main repository from your fork branch.

*Google how to use Github Desktop, I'm not going to explain it here.*

## Locations

Within the assets folder, you will find the `kubejs` folder. This is where all of the assets for the custom modpack items are located.
Other folders are to edit content from other mods, for example, the `minecraft` folder is for editing textures from vanilla Minecraft.

## Submitting your work

Assignments will be given in the **issues** tab of the repository.
With your assignment, you will be given the locations and names for the textures to reduce confusion.

Once you have completed your assignment, open a pull request to the main repository from your fork branch.
